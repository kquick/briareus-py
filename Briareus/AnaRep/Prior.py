       along with a list of (Briareus.Types) objects.

       If with_lock is True (the default) then the file is locked for
       exclusive access (and this process will wait for 180 1 second
       intervals---3 minutes---for the lock to be released); this is
       useful to prevent multiple instances of Briareus from
       processing the same file at the same time and generating
       conflicting results (especially wrt. notifications).  The
       with_lock can also be set to a non-zero numeric value
       indicating the maximum number of seconds to wait for the lock
       to be released.

       Note that there is no explicit unlock operation.  The
       expectation is that the new report is written to a separate
       file which is than (atomically) renamed to replace this file
       where the new file is not locked.  The exit of this process
       will automatically release the lock as well.

       If the input file does not exist, it is created and locked, but
       remains empty.

       If the input cannot be processed correctly, an error is written
       to stderr and the file is still open and locked but the data is
       None instead of a list.

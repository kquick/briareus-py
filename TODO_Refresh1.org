Priority B means this should be done for better support but not needed for initial prototyping
Priority C means this is extended functionality to be added later

** TODO [#A] fryingpan home page is hand-maintained.  BAD!
    Out of sync (e.g. Lanston discovered a reference to the "saw"
    project and not "saw-script" project.

** TODO [#C] fryingpan evaluations are slow
   Occurring at intervals larger than the desired evaluation period of
   600s.  Best current case (with ~25 PR's) seems to be just under
   1000s, with averages around 1800s, and peaks (new nixpkgs) of of
   7300-8100 s (~ 2hrs).  Implementation of separate input collection
   job has helped this considerably (the current peak used to be the
   average) but it still seems that evaluations are slow, and this
   contributes to longer build times overall.  More investigation into
   what might be making these slow and how to speed them up.
** TODO [#C] references may be out-of-sync
   Builds are now a 3-stage process:
    1. briareus runs and determines the build configs
    2. hydra-evaluator pulls and runs new config
    3. hydra-queue-runner performs build
   However, the output of 1 for submodules identifies specific
   revisions for the submodules but not the project repo (still a
   branch-name, like "master"), so it's possible that a delay between
   1 and 2 could allow updating of the project repo to change the
   submodule configurations but then mis-leadingly build the wrong
   submodule configurations when step 2 eventually runs (see slowdown
   described above).

   This seems like it would get un-stuck when #1 runs again, so it
   should resolve itself, but it would result in misleading
   intervening builds, especially due due the slow hydra-eval
   described above.

** TODO [#A] Generate sysconfig/briareus systemd jobs via `inputs` instead of inline?
    Cleaner specification in /etc/nixos/configuration.nix if these can
    just be included.  Also don't need \\ merge of systemd jobs.


** TODO [#B] PR back-rev on submodules
   * If a PR submodules are prior to the master and have been changed
     on the PR, should be flagged to not recommend a merge.
   * How to identify that a PR's submodules are *behind* master and
     that a merge will cause a retro-grade movement in submodule
     support?
** TODO [#C] fail back to default branch
  * master may not be the default branch if the target branch doesn't
    exist in a repo

   Use filterSource to exclude all sorts of dynamically-generated output automatically.
   * overrides?
   * disable?
   * language-specific?
** TODO [#B] add a check for a project repo branch that is only identified by a pull request on a subrepo
   ... but that branch has different gitmodules, that may have a new
   repo that itself has a pull request on (to really check testing to
   the fixpoint)

  * could submit a PR for standard operations (e.g. git submodules can
    be updated)
  * submits a PR on a valid build where the gitmodules is not HEAD?

** TODO [#C] system attributes
   What about marking specific jobs with attributes so that they are
   build on specific builders with a matching attribute?

** TODO [#C] other ecosystems
  * Rust + crate
  * C++ + cmake + boost

** TODO [#A] GitRepo handle parallel invocations
   If hh runs overlap, the globals set in the GitRepo actor cause both
   to hang (and mis-routing, see Matterhorn pickup of saw PR's on
   fryingpan).

** TODO [#A] Handle submodules added by PR
   When a PR modifies the set of repos by adding a submodule, there is
   a problem: the hydra input evaluation will require that input to be
   present for all configurations, but the input does not exist yet
   for some of the configurations.  This causes errors during evaluation

   The devnix support was modified to create a dummy derivation
   (yielding nothing, so the output should never be needed) for the
   configurations where the source does not exist yet, but this seems
   to only work for direct inputs and not correlated inputs.
** TODO [#C] support alternate Git forge (see ffmpeg)

** TODO alternative git submodules references
    The GHC git repository uses old git server, not github or gitlab.
    The submodule urls are of the form "../hadrian.git".  This works
    with a ~git clone --recursive git://git.haskell.org/ghc.git~, but
    the following fails:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ git clone git://git.haskell.org/ghc.git
    $ cd ghc
    $ git submodules init
    $ git submodules update
    ...
    fatal: repository '/home/kquick/work/AFRL-ADIDRUS-COSMAN/packages/hpc.git' does not exist
    fatal: clone of '/home/kquick/work/AFRL-ADIDRUS-COSMAN/packages/hpc.git' into submodule path '/home/kquick/work/AFRL-ADIDRUS-COSMAN/ghc8.8/libraries/hpc' failed
    Failed to clone 'libraries/hpc'. Retry scheduled
    ...
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    Check to see that Briareus can handle a repo of this type.

** TODO Merge testing
   Github offers also a merged version of the code.  This is
   potentially useful.  Consider the what4 expression tests along with
   dropping the conjunctive form: these two might be incompatible but
   this wouldn't be detected until merge time.  Should briareus try
   to build a merged version OR should it detect out-of-date and
   generate warnings?

** TODO PR marking synchronization
   At present, the git commit associated with a PR is not tracked
   through the pr_projstatus or pr_fullstatus information, so it's
   possible that if there are multiple commits to a PR that the status
   reporting can get out of sync.

   Forge status reporting should eventually resolve correctly, since
   two rapid commits could cause status from the first commit to be
   reported on the second, but these should be overwritten by status
   from that second commit.

   Email reporting may be incorrect.

   It would be better to be able to confirm the build result correctly
   matches the commit (and latest status), but this will require much
   more tracking of github refs, and is made more difficult by the
   pre-project input staging.  It should be possible though to get a
   build result and walk the Hydra information to determine the proper
   input reference used in that build and tag that reference.

** TODO [#B] gitlab private repo access
    According to gitlab folks, the personal fork of a private repo
    that has a merge request can be obtained from a
    refs/merge-requests/:iid ref in the target repository, or just the
    sha from the target repo

** TODO [#A] ability to mark some combos as necessary and some as optional
    ForgeStatus should be based only on necessary
** TODO [#A] prioritize builds
    Master builds and PR in order of most recent would be nice to
    prioritize over others.
** TODO [#B] recommend PR updates from master
    If a PR is failing and master is doing better, and master has new
    commits from the PR branch point, then the notification to the PR
    owner should probably indicate that a merge from master to the PR,
    and/or a rebase of the PR is recommended.
** TODO [#B] VCS name/URL fork mismatch

   Somehow the GitInfo reference for a repository got a reference to a
   forked repo rather than the primary repo:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   thespian> ask 78 status
   Response <class 'str'>: {'get_info_reqs': 5320,
     'remote_refreshes': 2658,
     'remote_reqs': 2660,
     'rsp_cache_keys': ['https://api.github.com/repos/pnwamk/what4-serialize/branches',
                        'https://api.github.com/repos/pnwamk/what4-serialize/pulls'],
     'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/pnwamk/what4-serialize'}
   thespian>
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   The main repo should have been https://github.com/GaloisInc/what4-serialize.

   The effect is that PR's and such on the main repo were ignored.

   The current fix: restart the core briareus service.

   The cause of this should be found and fixed.

** DONE [#A] forge status refresh bug
   DEADLINE: <2020-03-24 Tue>
    Situation:
     * PR changes committed
     * Briareus runs, marks that revision in the PR as in-progress
     * Frying pan running, hasn't finished builds yet
     * More PR changes committed
       - The new changes occlude the previous status, but since
         Briareus thinks it already set "in-progress" status, it does
         not update.
    Solution:
     * Comparison for SetForgeStatus needs to take into account the
       sha revision it has set the commit on, either in the
       Notification match or as part of the targetrepos/updated
       settings.
** TODO [#A] correlate PR ref with build
   Current problem:
      1. Create PR
      2. Builds fail
      3. Push update to PR (ref1)
      4. Briareus immediately tags ref1 with the failure from step 2.
      5. proj-inputs.jobsets, then proj-inputs.update_inputs, then
         proj.jobsets, then eval of proj.pr is needed to mark PR.ref1
         as in-progress, and this sequence can take an hour.
   Need to just mark PR ref as in-progress when PR updated.

   Solution: Capture inputs for a BuildSys result, compare inputs to
     PRCfg refs and mark as InProgress/Pending if no match?

   Note: could support actual difference between Pending and
   InProgress for Gitlab.
** TODO [#A] job and builder assignment
    The bike, sike, s2n, and kyber tests are long running, and if
    there are multiple PR's, then a single change can end up making
    all of the builders busy, which prevents other work from being
    attended to.

    This is particularly acute when a PR is updated (see "correlate PR
    ref with build") because it delays the builds for the .jobsets and
    update_inputs that would allow the new PR update to even be
    recognized and scheduled so that the PR is marked InProgress by
    SetForgeStatus.

    Would be nice to mark these jobs with a "long-job" attribute that
    could also be attached to a subset of workers.  This would slow
    down the throughput for these, but prevent them from blocking the
    main set.

    However, this would prevent other workers from being used when
    they are available and the only remaining builds left are these
    long-jobs.
